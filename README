CHMLib version 0.40 is included as a static library. If you wish to build a 
newer version, pull down https://github.com/jedwing/CHMLib and open the
included Visual Studio solution. Once compiled copy libchm.lib to libchmsharp/.

Make sure the build targets (release or debug) are the same for both CHMLib and
libchmsharp.
